I’m a full-stack developer with hands-on experience building web applications using the MERN stack. I mainly work on backend development, including designing REST APIs, handling authentication, managing databases, and implementing server-side logic, while also integrating these features with clean and responsive React interfaces.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable solutions. Along with JavaScript-based development, I also have working knowledge of Python and am comfortable learning new technologies when required.

I’m continuously improving my skills by building projects, exploring best practices, and gaining practical experience in real-world development workflows.      </motion.p>
